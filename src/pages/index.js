    <h1>Social media is ruining your life.</h1>

    <p>
      You've probably heard a lot of the disadvantages of social media by now.
      Here's just a few of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Becoming addicted to checking how many likes and followers you have
      </li>
      <li>
        Constantly comparing your life to curated versions of your friends and
        celebrities
      </li>
      <li>Getting angry over irrelevant issues</li>
      <li>Being unable to focus, always have an urge to check something</li>
      <li>
        Gives you an artificial sense of being social instead of making real
        human contact
      </li>
      <li>Being constantly fed ads to make you unsatisfied</li>
      <li>
        Getting a diet of misinformation from fake news and clickbait headlines
      </li>
      <li>
        Having your privacy totally disregarded just to make more money for a
        company
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      People are starting to wake up to the dark side of social media. The
      companies promised a lot: that we would be more connected, build new
      groups of friends, and keep up to date about the latest news. But now
      we're more disconnected and depressed than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      These companies don't care about you. You're the product being sold to
      advertisers. They care about quarterly reports more than the lofty goals
      they promised.
    </p>
    <p>If you've had enough of being manipulated, it's time to stop.</p>
    <h3>What is #30DayNoSocialChallenge?</h3>
    <p>
      The challenge is to <strong>stay off all social media for 30 days</strong>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      That means no Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit or any
      endlessly-scrolling social media sites. No posting, no checking, no
      nothing. If you have to ask if it's social media, it probably is. No
      contact for 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? In 30 days, you can help to rewire your brain and break free of the
      addiction. You can spend more time in the moment, instead of being caught
      up in distractions all day. You can spend time being actually social with
      friends, instead of pretending you are by scrolling through Instagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      After 30 days, you can go back if you want toâ€”but this time you can be
      much more conscious about it.
    </p>
    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>
      It started for me whenever I started using Twitter again. It promised a
      lot of benefits: it's useful for professional networking, building an
      audience, and keeping up on the latest industry news. Great, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      But just months later, I was obsessed with checking it, hoping for likes,
      retweets and new followers. It's like I couldn't control myself, I'd check
      when I'm eating with my girlfriend, before bed, and the first thing in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was making me crazy. I started to feel like an addict. I hated that I
      didn't feel in control of my life any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I was listening to other people all over the world talk
      about how social media was having a negative effect on their lives. It's a
      huge problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to quit, but I had the idea to help others to do the same.
      Together, we can all break free.
